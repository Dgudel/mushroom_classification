# Mushroom Classification

The project uses the mushroom images dataset uploaded from the Kaggle website (https://www.kaggle.com/maysee/mushrooms-classification-common-genuss-images). The dataset contains 6714 images of mushrooms. The dataset is divided into 9 folders, each of them containing images of mushrooms of a separate class. There are nine classes of mushrooms in the dataset in total: Agaricus, Amanita, Boletus, Cortinarius, Entoloma, Hygrocybe, Lactarius, Russula, Suillus.

The purpose of the project is to apply transfer learning for training classifiers that would be able to correctly classify mushrooms - that is, to provide labels to images of various mushrooms, corresponding to their actual classes.

The file 'mushrooms_geras_copy.ipynb' consists of two parts:

- the exploratory analysis of the dataset of mushroom images;
- building, training, fine-tuning, and evaluating classifiers able to predict mushroom classes as well as predicting mushroom classes based on the trained models.

The models themselves were not uploaded due to the Github storage limitations.
